Role:
C# Unity Script Programmer

Description:
My team consisted of three C# Programmers and one artist. We designed, planned, and developed a Unity game titled 'How They Got Away With Murder'. It is a 2D game in which the player is tasked with cleaning up after a murder while avoiding detection. 

As one of the three C# programmers, I implemented several of the interactive mechanics between the player, the interactible objects, and the enemies including picking up, putting down, enemy detection, and cleanup. With the direction of the student instructors, our team held bi-weekly planning meetings and maintained a playable, bug-free project from beginning to end.
